# Flutter DevOPS

![Flutter DevOps](./media/flutter-devops.png)

Do you want to be able to depend on your set up to push out 
a professional flutter app on weekends after working your weekday job?

Stackflow is filled with people with messed up devOPS asking why their sdk is not operating or showing errors when building. Yes, it might seem boring but if you give a shit, then maybe you should listen and get the devOPS right so you can produce predictable flutter app code!

Ah ah! Life is unfair as the ones that accept that their devOPS should be perfect are pushing out that killer flutter app on weekends while at the same time working their weekday job whereas you are deflecting blame. Wise up already!
